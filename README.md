# Mixture of Models Project

This project aims to create a "mixture of models" system, which involves generating a dataset, training a model, and deploying it as a web service. The project is divided into three main parts:

## 1. Dataset Generation (dataset_build)

Located in the `dataset_build/` directory, this part focuses on creating a comprehensive dataset that contains:
- Instructions
- Responses from various models
- Evaluations of these responses

The dataset generation process involves:
- Loading datasets from Hugging Face
- Using multiple language models to generate responses
- Evaluating the quality of these responses
- Compiling all this information into a structured dataset

For more details, see the [dataset_build README](dataset_build/README.md).

## 2. Model Training (model_train)

The `model_train/` directory contains the code and resources for training a model using the dataset generated in the first part. This phase involves:
- Preprocessing the generated dataset
- Defining and implementing the model architecture
- Training the model on the preprocessed data
- Evaluating the model's performance
- Fine-tuning and optimizing the model as needed

(Note: This part is yet to be implemented)

## 3. Web Service Deployment (web_service)

The `web_service/` directory will contain the necessary code to deploy the trained model as a web service. This will involve:
- Setting up a web server (e.g., Flask, FastAPI)
- Implementing API endpoints for model inference
- Handling input/output processing
- Ensuring efficient and scalable deployment

(Note: This part is yet to be implemented)
